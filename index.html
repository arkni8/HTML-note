    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <h3>This note starts with introduction to HTML.</h3></center>
    <hr>
    <p>HTML is the building block of a website and determines the elements and materials used to make a website.</p>
    <p>We start writing HTML out with something we call 'Boilerplate'.</p>
    <p><em>'emmet'</em> is a plugin (or extension) which helps complete the different common types of elements used in HTML. Writing out <strong>'html'</strong> gives
      out the complete boilerplate setup automatically thanks to the plugin <em>emmet</em>.</p>
    <p>It is advised to use <em>Emphasis</em> HTML element to <i>italicize</i> elements and <strong>Strong</strong> HTML element to make text <b>bold</b>.</p>
    <h3><strong>All of these can be checked along with the associated attributes and syntax on sites like <a href="https://mdn.dev/">MDN</a>.</strong></h3>
    <p>Every site has something called Metadata dubbed as <em>'meta'</em> and defined while putting the template for boilerplate which is accessed by search engines
      to look up keywords and give more information in general.</p>
    <p>We definte <em>'charset'</em> (Characcter set) so the browser renders the HTML out properly with corresponding encoding. <strong>utf-8</strong> covers almost all the symbols from different
      language from all over the world and generally used for the almost all website by default.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Wondering how to add bullet points in HTML? You do this -    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1st item<ul>
        <li>1st 1st item</li>
        <li>2nd 1st item</li>
        <li>3rd 1st item</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>2nd item</li>
      <li>3rd item</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>What did I do? Maybe try inspecting element to find out! *wink wink*</b></p>
    <p>Okay, we added 'unordered list' but how do I add an ordered list( or you may call bullet points)?</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Ayyy <ol type='i'>
        <li>1st item</li>
        <li>2nd item</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>3rd item</li>
      <li>4th item</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So as you can see, we can put different types of ordered list in html. Just check <a href="https://mdn.dev/"><b>MDN</b></a> for all the types of list you can put down.</p>
    <img src="#"    alt="thumbsup.exe" width="150" height="150">
    <p>Have you check how to put hyperlinks in the HTML document? Well, go ahead and <em>inspect</em> the page now and see how a <u><strong>hyperlink</strong></u> is placed.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>To organise things and render them in an ordderly fashion in a HTML document, we often use tables. This is how it goes - </p>
    <table border="15">
      <thead>
        <th>1st bakwas</th>
        <th>2nd bakwas</th>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>heyho</td>
        <td>heyyo</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>nayno</td>
        <td>nonay</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Feel free to <em>inspect</em> elements and see how its done. </p>
    <p>You can even insert images at table data. That will also work nicely and give you interesting styling option.</p>
    <p><strong>Thing to note is attributes to table have been deprecated in favor of CSS styling so attributes like border are no longer used.</strong> </p>
    <br>
    <p>Next up, we are going to see how to use HTML forms.</p>
    <p>HTML forms are invoked by <strong>form</strong> keyword from  <em>emmet</em> plugin.</p>
    <p>You can see how its setup by inspecting element on this page <a href="Contact.html"> here</a> but here are some of the attributes you might use.</p>

    <table cellspacing="10" border="5">
      <thead>
        <th>Command type</th>
        <th>Function</th>
      </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>'text'</td>
      <td>For inputing text</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'submit'</td>
      <td>Works as a submit button.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'textarea'</td>
      <td>It is a different command, and not used inside input and it is used for inputing a longer phrase.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>password</td>
      <td>To mask the text being input, especially used when typing password.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
